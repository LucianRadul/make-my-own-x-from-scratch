# Project ideas
Place to collect all the resources and ideas that I have for coding projects. For now it is/will be rather rough as it's meant to be more of a notes-storing repository than an organised thing.

## Specific applications
- C++ source file finder from header:
  - Input: a .hpp file
  - Output: locations of the .cpp files that implement the .hpp file
- Header file generator:
  - Input: a .cpp file
  - Output: a .hpp file with declarations and the .cpp file that implements all of them
- CMakeLists.txt generator from .cpp file. At least to make a library, not necessarily an executable

## Make from scratch:
